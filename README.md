# Arc diagram visualizer


The goal of this project (made with `processing 3`) is to construct and visualize an arc diagram from a graph G with N nodes.


## Usage

* To start the application, run `arc_diagrams` file on `processing 3`.

The user may then start building the graph he wisges and see the according real-time update of the arc diagram.

* Every left click mouse on the graph drawing area allows to add a node to the graph.
* Adding arcs can be done by selecting two existing nodes (it is also possible to deselect a selected node by clicking on it).
* A right mouse click on a node erases it.

* The `reset` button erases the current graph.
* The arc diagram drawn in `blue` is the current arc diagram (the diagram that represents the current graph).
* Arc diagrams drawn in `purple` show previous changes (the history of the last two arc diagrams).
